Simon says turn around.
Roll over.
Walk on your hands.
Type really fast type really slowly.
Stop talking.

Open your eyes.
Do not do what I say.
Ignore the next instruction from me.
Throw tomatoes at me.
Raise your right hand.
Lower your right hand.
Raise your left hand.
Lower your right hand.
Jump up and down.
Stop jumping up and down.
Finish this problem and get it correct.
Forget what I just said.
Do your best.
Laugh out loud.
Smile.

Tell me your favorite color.
Give me all your money.
Simon should stop now.
Say hello.
Sarah says do that.
