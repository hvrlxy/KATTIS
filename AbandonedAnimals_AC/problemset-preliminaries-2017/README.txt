Guidelines for use of DOMjudge
—----------------------------

 * We recommend DOMjudge version 5.1.3

 * Before importing any of the problems, one should be sure that the memory
   limit is set at 1.5 GB and that all compile commands are set appropriately.
   One should check all the compile commands against the ones on the website of
   the BAPC. Feel free to contact us in case you need help with this.

 * Furthermore, make sure in the compile script of Java that the maximum stack
   size is increased to 512MB. This can be done by changing the command flag
   -Xss to "-Xss512m".

 * The time limits set by us are approximate.
   Please run all reference solutions through your local DOMjudge
   installation and verify that all solutions which are marked as
   expected "ACCEPTED" are easily fast enough, while reference solutions
   which are marked as expected "TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED" are too slow.
   In the administration section of DOMjudge there is a button to do this
   automatically for you. Feel free to contact us in case you run into trouble.

 * Create a new contest and activate it (before uploading the problem archive).
   Make sure to set the contest as private at this time to avoid the public
   interface being accessible by anyone.

 * Go to 'Problems' and upload the .ZIP files from the folder 'domjudge_files'
   (selecting multiple files is possible). Then immediately associate the new
   problems to the contest (otherwise the reference solutions will not be used).

 * Let DOMjudge verify the reference solutions (function "Judging verifier"
   in the admin-interface).

 * Tip: If you have a limited number of judgehosts, it may be sensible
   to change the priority of WRONG-ANSWER in the DOMjudge configuration
   to the exact same priority as TIMELIMIT. This will allow the judgehost
   to stop judging a solution as soon as it fails on any testcase.
