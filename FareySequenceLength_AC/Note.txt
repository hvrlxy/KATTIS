Solve this problem using recursion:
the base case will be when f(1) = 2
when f(n) (with n>1) will be consist of f(n - 1) + number of number that are relatively prime to f(n)

- Should do dynamic programming???

-Must create a function to calculate all the number of coprime of n that are also less than n
